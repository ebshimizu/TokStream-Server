TokStream-Server
================

Example server based on node.js to accompany the TokStream App.

If you'd like to use it, just clone it, fill in your API keys in the
`tokstream_server.js` file, update the URLs in the `client.html` file,
and you've got a basic TokBox server that can create a single session
and a basic client to view the streams in the session.
